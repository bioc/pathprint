Title: Pathway fingerprinting for analysis of gene expression arrays
Description: Algorithms to convert a gene expression array provided as
        an expression table or a GEO reference to a 'pathway
        fingerprint', a vector of discrete ternary scores representing
        high (1), low(-1) or insignificant (0) expression in a suite of
        pathways.
