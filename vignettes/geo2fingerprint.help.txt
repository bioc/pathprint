Description
Create a pathway fingerprint directly from a GEO accession number. 

Usage
geo2fingerprint(GSM, GEOpath, geneset,
		enrichmentMethod = c("SCG", "SCE"),
		transformation = c("rank", "squared.rank", "log.rank"),
		statistic = c("mean", "median"),
		normalizedScore, progressBar)

Arguments
GSM	GEO reference ID (GSM)
GEOpath	path for storing downloaded GEO files
geneset	either a list containing of named vectors of entrez gene ids corresponding to pathways or "KEGG and Wikipathways and static" (default) for a combination of KEGG, wikipathways and static modules
enrichmentMethod	algorithm used to calculate gene enrichment score, one of "SCG" for single.chip.GSEA or "SCE for single.chip.enrichment, default is "SCG"
statistic	"mean" or "median" - summary statistic to be applied if enrichmentMethod is single.chip.enrichment, default is "mean"
normalizedScore	if enrichmentMethod is single.chip.enrichment and statistic = "mean" uses parametric method to assign a significance score, default is FALSE
progressBar	if enrichmentMethod is single.chip.enrichment shows progress of script, set to FALSE for possible faster running, default is TRUE

Details
The function 'getGEO' within the package 'GEOquery' is used to download a table of expression values for a single array in GEO for a given GSM ID.
This array is annotated with Entrez Gene IDs using customCDF annotations (Evolving Gene/Transcript Definitions Significantly Alter the Interpretation of GeneChip Data. Nucleic Acid Research 33 (20), e175O, http://brainarray.mbni.med.umich.edu/Brainarray/Database/CustomCDF/genomic_curated_CDF.asp), using the function 'annotate'.

See help pages on exprs2fingerprint for details on the enrichment algorithms and associated arguments.

Value
Returns a list containing elements 'SCG', 'platform' and 'species'
'SCG' returns a dataframe with a single column, 'expression', a numeric vector of the expression of each pathway in the list 'geneset' in the array relative to the GEO corpus.
'Platform' returns a character vector of the GEO reference of the array platform used
'Species' returns a character vector of the species used in the experiment
