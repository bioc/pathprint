Description
Create a pathway fingerprint from a gene expression table. 

Usage
exprs2fingerprint(express, platform, species, progressBar = TRUE)

Arguments
exprs	expression table, see Details
species	"human" or mouse"
platform	platform GEO reference
progressBar	if a progress bar is required to track script progress 

Details
The exprs should be a matrix or dataframe of the expression values, with rownames containing probe names and colnames the experiment IDs.
The function converts the gene expression values to a ternary matrix of pathway expression values, (-1,0,1) corresponding to (low, background, high).
The array is first annotated with Entrez Gene IDs using customCDF annotations (Evolving Gene/Transcript Definitions Significantly Alter the Interpretation of GeneChip Data. Nucleic Acid Research 33 (20), e175O, http://brainarray.mbni.med.umich.edu/Brainarray/Database/CustomCDF/genomic_curated_CDF.asp). Then pathway expression scores are calculated and normalized against the appropriate distribution for the given platform in the GEO corpus.
There is a progressBar to track the script, can be set to FALSE for possibly marginally faster running

Value
Returns a dataframe containing the pathway fingerprint for each of column in the expression table. Rownames correspond to the pathways in the fingerprint and colnames to the experiment IDs

Examples

# Download dataset from GEO
library(GEOquery)
GSE7562 <- getGEO("GSE7562")

# extract data table
GSE7562.exprs <- exprs(GSE7562$GSE7562_series_matrix.txt.gz))

# calculate fingerprint
GSE7562.fingerprint <- exprs2fingerprint(GSE7562.exprs, platform = "GPL570", species = "human")
