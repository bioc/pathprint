Description
Calculates a consensus given a matrix of fingerprints

Usage
consensusFingerprint(fingerprintframe, threshold)

Arguments
fingerprintframe - matrix of fingerprints from which the consensus will be calculated	
threshold - threshold value (between 0 and 1), see details

Details
For each pathway the mean fingerprint score, m, is calculated.
Then,
If m > threshold, consensus = +1
If m < threshold, consensus = -1 
Otherwise, consensus = 0

Value
Consensus fingerprint vector

Usage

# load fingerprint matrix and pluripotent reference
data(GEO.fingerprint.matrix)
data(pluripotents.frame)

# create consensus fingerprint
pluripotent.consensus<-consensusFingerprint(GEO.fingerprint.matrix[,pluripotents.frame$GSM], threshold=0.9)
